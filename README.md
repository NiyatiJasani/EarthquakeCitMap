# UCSD-Unfolding-Maps-Project

The attached src code is based on the online course offered at coursera called ['Object Oriented Programming in Java']  (https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java/) by University of San Diego California.

* The course focuses on creating an interactive geographical map with information of a dataset.
* To create this project, youâ€™ll be working with a package called Unfolding Maps- a library for interactive maps and geovisualizations.
* Built an interactive graphical program in Java
* Design classes to make use of object-oriented programming paradigms


**Some of the things I learnt in this project:**

*  Design classes to make use of object-oriented programming paradigms
*  Implementation of inheritance and polymorphism in the creation of a Java GUI.
*  Use of event handlers
